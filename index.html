          Place the prawns in a pot and add enough water to cover. Boil for 5
          minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid, and set aside.\r\nHeat 2
          tablespoons of oil in a saucepan. Add the onion; cook and stir until
          soft. Mix in the parsley, wine, tomatoes, garlic and remaining olive
          oil. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, or until the
          sauce is thickened.\r\nWhile the sauce is simmering, the prawns should
          become cool enough to handle. First remove the legs by pinching them,
          and then pull off the shells, leaving the head and tail on.\r\nWhen
          the sauce has thickened, stir in the prawns. Bring to a simmer again
          if the sauce has cooled with the prawns, and cook for about 5 minutes.
          Add the feta and remove from the heat. Let stand until the cheese
          starts to melt. Serve warm with slices of crusty bread.\r\nThough
          completely untraditional, you can add a few tablespoons of stock or
          passata to this recipe to make a delicious pasta sauce. Toss with
          pasta after adding the feta, and serve.
